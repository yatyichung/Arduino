# Arduino
I have completed these 3 arduino projects as part of the Interactive Electronic Design coursework during my undergraduate degree at University of Toronto.

I have created an escape room Arduino. It is a hypothetical situation: when the player enter the room (when the distance sensor sensed a certain distance), the door will close atomically (the servo will turn to 90 deg). Player will have to complete a few question correctly in order to leave the escape room (a few questions will show up on the LCD screen). For each question, the player will have four choices to choose from (the click buttons). If answered wrong, a beep sound (speaker) will appear and the light (LED Strip) will flash to notify player, it will return to the first question. If answered correctly, it will proceed to the next question. When all the questions are answered correct
